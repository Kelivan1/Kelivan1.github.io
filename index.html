            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Junior in the honors College at Oregon State Majoring in Computer Science. This Spring I will participate in my first
                    internship as part of the MECOP program. I am the secretary of the A.I. Club and a member of the ACM club. I enjoy playing sports
                    and I am a practice player for the Oregon State Women's basketball team. </p>
